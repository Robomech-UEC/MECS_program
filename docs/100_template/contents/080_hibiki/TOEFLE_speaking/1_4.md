## Model Answer (Score 4.0 Level)
In the lecture, the professor explains how visual elements in art convey emotions. Colors are important: for example, red evokes strong emotions like excitement or anger, while blue creates a calm feeling. Texture is also important: rough textures convey strong emotions, while smooth textures create calmness. Artists often combine these elements. For example, strong colors with rough textures can evoke intense or chaotic emotions, while soft colors with smooth textures produce a calm mood. When the visual elements are consistent, the viewer easily understands the intended emotion, but if they conflict, it can feel unusual or unsettling. This shows that artists use visual elements to communicate meaning and emotion effectively.
