# TOEFL Speaking Task 2 Review

## Question Summary (in English)
The question asks whether it is better to take classes online or in a traditional classroom. The speaker should choose one option and explain reasons with supporting details or examples.

---

## Model Answer (Score 4.0 level)
I prefer learning in a traditional classroom because it allows better interaction between teachers and students. For example, when students look confused, the teacher can immediately explain again or give additional examples. This makes it easier for everyone to follow the lecture. Also, in a classroom, students can discuss the material with their classmates. In my experience, when I talk about the lesson with friends after class, I understand the content much better. For these reasons, I think classroom learning is more effective than online courses.

## Problems in Your Answer
1. **Vocabulary errors**  
   - "running in classroom" → should be "learning in a classroom"  

2. **Grammar issues**  
   - "teacher can see if students are better understanding" → should be "teacher can see whether students understand"  
   - "understanding for the lecture" → should be "understanding of the lecture"  

3. **Fluency issues**  
   - Frequent use of "uh" disrupts smooth delivery.  

4. **Development issues**  
   - Reasons are valid (teacher can check understanding / students can talk to classmates) but lack concrete, personal examples.

## Improvements Needed
1. Use correct expressions: "classroom learning," "face-to-face learning."  
2. Keep grammar simple and accurate: "students understand better," not "are better understanding."  
3. Reduce filler words like "uh" for smoother delivery.  
4. Add a personal example (e.g., "In my math class, I understood better after asking questions directly").
