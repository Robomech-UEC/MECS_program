# TOEFL Speaking Task 3 Review

## Question Summary (in English)
The article proposes offering evening computer science classes in order to reduce daytime overcrowding and ensure that all students have access to computers.  
In the conversation, however, the man disagrees with this plan because students are too busy at night and the cost of running evening classes would be higher. Instead, he suggests that simply buying more computers would be cheaper and more effective.

## Model Answer (Score 4.0 level)
The proposal in the article is to offer evening computer science classes in order to reduce daytime overcrowding and ensure computer access for all students. However, the man disagrees with this idea. First, he says that students are usually busy in the evenings with jobs, family responsibilities, or extracurricular activities, so very few would actually take night classes. Second, he argues that it would be too expensive because the department would need to hire more teachers and keep the buildings open later. Instead, he suggests that a better solution would be to simply buy more computers, since their prices have gone down and there is enough space in the classrooms to add them.

## Problems in Your Answer
1. **Vocabulary/Word choice errors**  
   - "The student offer" → should be "The department proposes"  
   - "not more not uh much students can touch the computer" → should be "not enough students can use the computers"  

2. **Grammar issues**  
   - "students has" → should be "students have"  
   - "it lost its purpose" → should be "it does not serve its purpose"  

3. **Fluency issues**  
   - Frequent fillers ("uh") and repetitions ("not not much students") reduce clarity.  

4. **Structure**  
   - Lacks a clear conclusion such as "Therefore, the man disagrees with the proposal."

## Improvements Needed
1. Use **accurate vocabulary**: say "proposal" or "the department" instead of "student offer."  
2. Keep grammar simple and correct: "students have," "buying computers is cheaper."  
3. Reduce **fillers and repetition** for smoother delivery.  
4. Add a **clear conclusion** to reinforce the opinion.
