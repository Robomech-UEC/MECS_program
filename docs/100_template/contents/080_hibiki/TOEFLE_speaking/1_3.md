# TOEFL Speaking Task 4 Review

## Question Summary (in English)
The lecture explains how nonverbal signals, such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice, can reinforce or contradict verbal messages. The professor gives two examples: one with his uncle visiting him and one with his daughter while building a birdhouse.

---

## Your Answer (Summary)
- First example: Professor’s verbal message to his uncle was “What a surprise!” but his nonverbal signals (body language) showed happiness, which his uncle could feel.  
- Second example: Professor said “I’m okay” after hitting his thumb, but his face and hand movements showed pain, so his daughter realized he wasn’t really okay.

## Model Answer (Score 4.0 Level)
In the lecture, the professor gives two examples to show how nonverbal communication interacts with verbal messages. In the first example, his uncle visited him unexpectedly. Although he said, “What a surprise! How nice to see you!”, his wide eyes, big smile, and jumping up and down clearly showed his happiness. His verbal and nonverbal messages were consistent, which made his emotions convincing. In the second example, while building a birdhouse with his daughter, he accidentally hit his thumb. He said, “Don’t worry, honey. It’s nothing,” but his facial expression, shaking hand, and trembling voice showed that he was in pain. His verbal and nonverbal messages conflicted, so his daughter understood the true situation. These examples illustrate that nonverbal signals can either reinforce or contradict verbal communication.
